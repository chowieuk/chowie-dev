I've always found something quite captivating about generative art — graphics conjured by algorithms — and the beauty that can arise from the triumph of entropy over chaos.

Whether its a simple random walk like the one at the top of this post, or the infinite descent of zooming into the boundary of a fractal, there's just something about them that catches the eye.

>>> Mandelbrot sequence

Mandelbrot coined the term fractal, and encouraged readers to look at the world differently in his seminal work _The Fractal Geometry of Nature_[^1]. It's not surprising that the popularity of fractal art co-incided with his efforts to use computers to tame these dimensionally eccentric beasts into their flatten forms for human consumption.

>>> Discussion about DLA, Brownian motion, random walks, and snowflakes

>>> Discussion about clouds, coasts, and applications in computer graphics and radio communications

>>> Comparison with the recent progress of graphics produced by deep learning and generative models, AKA 'AI' art. Diffusion models, GANs, Autoregressive Models, VAEs, NeRFS.

>>> Discussion about the difference between original graphics created by humans, forged from Mathematics, and the bastard offspring you get when you train a model on all of the former you get your hands on.

>>> I wonder what Benoit would have thought of the advent of Stable Diffusion, and the resurgance in interest in generative art.
