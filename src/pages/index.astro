            <p>Welcome to my over-engineered devlog.</p>
            <p>
                This is my little corner of the small batch internet, where I
                document projects, experiments, and insights gained on a journey
                towards life long learning in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it looks a little sparse, that's because we're only just
                getting started.
            </p>
